### Sample Results

### Overview
PyTorch implementation for CRAFT text detector that effectively detect text area by exploring each character region and affinity between characters. The bounding box of texts are obtained by simply finding minimum bounding rectangles on binary map after thresholding character region and affinity scores. 

## Updates
**13 Jun, 2019**: Initial update
**20 Jul, 2019**: Added post-processing for polygon result


## Getting started
### Install dependencies
#### Requirements
- PyTorch>=0.4.1
- torchvision>=0.2.1
- opencv-python>=3.4.2
- check requiremtns.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training
The code for training is not included in this repository, and we cannot release the full training code for IP reason.


### Test instruction using pretrained model
- Download [Trained Model on IC13,IC17](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jk4eGD7crsqCCg9C9VjCLkMN3ze8kutZ)
* Run with pretrained model
``` (with python 3.7)
python test.py --trained_model=[weightfile] --test_folder=[folder path to test images]
```

The result image and socre maps will be saved to `./result` by default.

### Arguments
* `--trained_model`: pretrained model
* `--text_threshold`: text confidence threshold
* `--low_text`: text low-bound score
* `--link_threshold`: link confidence threshold
* `--canvas_size`: max image size for inference
* `--mag_ratio`: image magnification ratio
* `--poly`: enable polygon type result
* `--show_time`: show processing time
* `--test_folder`: folder path to input images
